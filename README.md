# Dockerfile Best Practices
This example showcases a common issue in Dockerfiles: using a large, generic base image. It also demonstrates how to fix it.

## Problem
The original `Dockerfile` uses `ubuntu:latest`, a very large and non-specific image. This causes several problems:

* **Large image size:** This leads to slower builds and larger deployments.
* **Inconsistency:** `latest` can change unexpectedly, potentially breaking the application.
* **Security vulnerabilities:** Older base images are more susceptible to exploits.

## Solution
The improved `DockerfileSolution.txt` uses a minimal base image (e.g., `python:3.9-slim-buster`) to reduce size and improve consistency.  It also specifies a version, avoiding unforeseen updates to the base image.

This example is easily adaptable to other languages by replacing `python:3.9-slim-buster` with an appropriate slim base image for your runtime.
